## Problem

> Result window is too large, from + size must be less than or equal to: [10000] but was [100005]. See the scroll API for a more efficient way to request large data sets. This limit can be set by changing the [index.max_result_window] index level setting.

This issue typically occurs when querying data in Elasticsearch. Specifically, it happens when you try to retrieve more documents than the `index.max_result_window` setting allows in a single request from an index. By default, this limit is 10,000.

## Explanation

One of the design goals of Elasticsearch is to ensure query efficiency and cluster stability. Returning a large number of results at once can lead to the following problems:

- **High memory consumption**: Returning a large number of results consumes a lot of memory, which can cause nodes to crash.
- **Performance degradation**: Handling a large amount of data increases CPU and I/O load, affecting query performance and response times.
- **Network bandwidth usage**: Transmitting a large amount of data consumes significant network bandwidth, potentially causing network congestion and delays.
To avoid these issues, Elasticsearch introduces the `index.max_result_window` parameter to limit the maximum number of results a single query can return. The default value for this parameter is 10,000, and it can be adjusted as needed, but setting it too high can still lead to the aforementioned problems.

## Solutions

1. **Using the Scroll API**

If you need to retrieve a large amount of data, it is recommended to use the Scroll API. The Scroll API is designed for large-scale data retrieval and is suitable for paginated retrieval of large datasets.
The basic steps are as follows:
Initialize a Scroll request
First, initialize a Scroll request to get the initial results and `scroll_id`:

```sh
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/your_index/_search?scroll=2m" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
   "query": {
      "match_all": {}
   },
   "size": 1000
}
'
   ```

The response to this request will include a scroll_id and the initial result set.

Retrieve more data
Use the returned scroll_id to get subsequent results. Each request will return a new scroll_id for the next request.

```sh
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_search/scroll" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
   "scroll": "2m",
   "scroll_id": "DnF1ZXJ5VGhlbkZldGNoBQAAAAAAABZkFlZ3bEdtcDd6eEtLZ1hJVldpdmlRT2cAAAAAAABWmhZe3RaRUlsdFJLZ3h3R2dNQmNLUUt5Zw=="
}
'
   ```

Replace the `scroll_id` field in the request body with the `scroll_id` returned from the previous step.

Complete example

```sh
# Initialize Scroll request
INITIAL_RESPONSE=$(curl -X GET "localhost:9200/your_index/_search?scroll=2m" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
   "query": {
      "match_all": {}
   },
   "size": 1000
}
')

# Extract initial scroll_id
SCROLL_ID=$(echo $INITIAL_RESPONSE | jq -r '._scroll_id')

# Get initial results
echo "Initial results:"
echo $INITIAL_RESPONSE | jq '.hits.hits'

# Loop to get subsequent results
while true; do
   RESPONSE=$(curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_search/scroll" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d"
   {
      "scroll": "2m",
      "scroll_id": "$SCROLL_ID"
   }
   ")

   # Extract new scroll_id
   SCROLL_ID=$(echo $RESPONSE | jq -r '._scroll_id')

   # Check if there are more results
   HITS=$(echo $RESPONSE | jq '.hits.hits')
   if [ "$HITS" == "[]" ]; then
      echo "No more results."
      break
   fi

   # Output results
   echo "Next batch of results:"
   echo $HITS
done
   ```

2. **Modify the `index.max_result_window` Parameter**

If you really need to return a large number of results at once, you can increase the value of `index.max_result_window`. However, this is only a temporary solution and not recommended for production environments.
Steps to increase `index.max_result_window`:
Open the Elasticsearch configuration file or modify the settings via API.
Modify the `index.max_result_window` parameter.
Example command:

```sh
PUT /your_index/_settings
{
   "index": {
      "max_result_window": 65536
   }
}
   ```

Note that setting this value too high can still lead to the performance and stability issues mentioned above.

## Explanation

Initialize request: Use a `match_all` query and the `size` parameter to specify the number of results returned per request.
Extract `scroll_id`: Use the jq tool to extract the `scroll_id` from the JSON response.
Loop to get results: Continuously use the new `scroll_id` to send requests until there are no more results.

## Summary

When retrieving large amounts of data, the best practice is to use the Scroll API to paginate the data, ensuring cluster stability and query efficiency. If you must adjust `index.max_result_window`, weigh the performance and stability considerations carefully.
